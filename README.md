Implementation Details
The game board is represented as a 2D NumPy array.
Players are represented by numerical values (1 for Player 1 and 2 for Player 2).
The Minimax algorithm is used to determine the computer's moves.
Alpha-Beta pruning is applied to optimize the Minimax algorithm.
Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy library
Acknowledgments
This implementation is for educational purposes and is inspired by the classic Connect Four game.

Feel free to fork and modify the code to suit your needs.

Enjoy the game!
